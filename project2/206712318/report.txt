Some Obstacels
Initially, I struggled with implementing the correct logic for charging different rates based on usage tiers. I was confused by whether it should be accumulative or calculated separatly.
Also, I spend most of my time ensuring that error messages are generated in the correct order (name, then power, then type) while not processing remaining input after an error is detected.

Test data (valid):
1. Residential (T1 only):
   Input: bryan z, 5, Residential
   Output: The bill for bryan zqwerty is $38.45
2. Residential (T1 and T2):
   Input: qwerty, 13.5, Residential
   output: The bill for qwerty is $91.45
3. Residential Customer (T1+T2+T3):
   Input: test, 25, Residential
   Ouput: The bill for test is $274.95
4. Business Customer (T1 only):
   Input: ABC, 8, Business
   Output: The bill for ABC is $79.95
5. Business Customer (T1 and T2):
   Input: 1, 13.5, Business
   Output: The bill for 1 is $147.45
6. Business Customer (T1+T2+T3):
   Input: APPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLE, 30, Business
   Output: The bill for APPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLE is $369.95

Test data (invalid and error input):
7. Zero Power Usage (Residential)
   Input: zero, 0, Residential
   Output: The bill for zero is $14.95
   Reason: Tests edge case of zero usage (only service charge)
8. Zero Power Usage (Business)
   Input: APPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLE, 0, Business
   Output: The bill for APPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLE is $19.95
   Reason: Tests edge case of zero usage for business (only service charge)
9. Exactly 10kW (T1 boundary)
   Input: test, 10, Residential
   Output: The bill for test is $59.95
   Reason: Tests exact boundary between T1 and T2
10. Exactly 20kW (T2 boundary)
    Input: test, 20, Residential
    Output: The bill for test is $224.95
    Reason: Tests exact boundary between T2 and T3
11. Negative Power Usage
    Input: test, -5, Residential
    Output: The power usage reading must be nonnegative.
    Reason: Tests error checking for negative power usage
12. Empty Customer Name
    Input: "empty", 10, Residential
    Output: You must enter a customer name.
    Reason: Tests error checking for empty customer name
13. Invalid Customer Type (lowercase)
    Input: test, 10, residential
    Output: The customer type is not valid.
    Reason: Tests that customer type is case-sensitive
14. Invalid Customer Type (misspelled)
    Input: test, 10, aaa
    Output: The customer type is not valid.
    Reason: Tests invalid customer type detection
15. Large Power Usage (Residential)
    Input: Big User, 100, Residential
    Output: The bill for Big User is $1424.95
    Reason: Tests high usage with all three tiers
16. Large Power Usage (Business)
    Input: aa, 100, Business
    Output: The bill for aa is $1969.95
    Reason: Tests high usage with all three tiers for business
17. Name with Special Characters
    Input: 我要打瓦！@#￥%……&*（）——+{}|, 15, Business
    Output: The bill for 我要打瓦！@#￥%……&*（）——+{}| is $159.45
    Reason: Tests handling of apostrophes and ampersands in names
18. Very Long Customer Name
    Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 10, Residential
    Output: The bill for aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is $59.95
    Reason: Tests handling of long customer names with multiple words (more than one line)

All test cases listed above are expected to be handled correctly by the program.
