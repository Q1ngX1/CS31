Some Obstacels
Initially, I struggled with implementing the correct logic for charging different rates based on usage tiers. I was confused by whether it should be accumulative or calculated separatly.
Also, I spend most of my time ensuring that error messages are generated in the correct order (name, then power, then type) while not processing remaining input after an error is detected.
