# CS31 Project 1 - Report

## Overview
This project involves understanding the provided C++ program and exploring different types of programming errors.

## Files Created

### 1. original.cpp (Step 2)
The original program that calculates and displays weather statistics.
- **Input:** Total days reviewed, rainy days, cold days (below 50°F)
- **Output:** Percentage of rainy and cold days with comparison
- **Testing:** Tested with various reasonable inputs to verify correct behavior

### 2. logic_error.cpp (Step 6)
A version with a logical error that compiles successfully but produces incorrect results.
- **Error Type:** Logic error in percentage calculation
- **Line with Error:** Line 22-23
- **Details:** Uses `100.0 + daysWithRain / daysReviewed` instead of `100.0 * daysWithRain / daysReviewed`
- **Result:** Produces percentages around 100% instead of correct values
- **Example:** Input: 30, 12, 8
  - Expected: 40.00%, 26.67%
  - Actual: 100.40%, 100.27%

### 3. compile_error.cpp (Step 7)
A version with two distinct compilation errors.
- **Error #1 (Line 27):** Missing semicolon at end of cout statement
  - `cout << pctRainy << "% were rainy."` (missing semicolon)
- **Error #2 (Line 39):** Undefined identifier
  - `undefined_variable` used without declaration
  
## Test Cases

### Original Program - Normal Inputs
- Input: 30 rainy days, 12 cold days out of 100 total
- Result: Displays correct percentages and comparison

### Original Program - Edge Cases
- All days rainy/cold
- No rainy/cold days
- Negative inputs (caught by validation)
- Invalid data (rainy + cold > total)

### Logic Error Program
- Same inputs produce incorrect percentage values (all near 100%)
- Still compiles and runs without crashing
- Logical validation code still works

### Compile Error Program
- Does not compile
- Two distinct error types that prevent successful build
